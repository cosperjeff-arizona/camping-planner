    <h1>Weather & Critical Safety Information</h1>
    
    <p>The elevation in that area is approximately 6,700 feet. Weather in early November can be highly variable.</p>
    <h2>Temperatures</h2>
    <p>Expect pleasant daytime highs in the <strong>mid-50s to low 60s Fahrenheit (12-17° C)</strong>. However, as soon as the sun goes down, temperatures will plummet. Nighttime lows can easily drop into the <strong>20s (-6 to -1° C)</strong>, and sometimes even the teens. <strong>Be prepared for freezing temperatures overnight.</strong></p>
    <div class="warning">
        <h2>Fire Restrictions</h2>
        <p>This is the most important thing to check. The fall can be very dry.</p>
        <p><strong>Action:</strong> A few days before you leave, you <strong>MUST</strong> check the official Coconino National Forest website or call the Flagstaff Ranger District (928-526-0866) for the latest fire restrictions. If restrictions are in place, you may only be able to use a propane stove and not have a wood campfire.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Firewood</h2>
    <p>Assuming campfires are allowed, you can gather dead and down wood. Do not cut down standing trees, living or dead. It's a good idea to bring a couple of starter logs or a bundle of firewood from a store just in case the wood you find is damp.</p>
    <h2>Water</h2>
    <p>There is no potable water. You must bring all the water you will need for drinking, cooking, and cleaning. A good rule of thumb is 1.5 gallons per person, per day.</p>
