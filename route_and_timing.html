    <h1>Camping Trip: Route, Timing, & Campsite Selection</h1>
    
    <h2>Route from Phoenix Area</h2>
    <p>Assuming you are starting from the Phoenix metro area, your route is straightforward:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Take <strong>I-17 North</strong> towards Flagstaff.</li>
        <li>Travel for approximately 130-140 miles, depending on your starting point.</li>
        <li>Take <strong>Exit 306 for Stoneman Lake Road</strong>.</li>
        <li>Turn right (east) onto Stoneman Lake Rd, which is also designated as Forest Road (FS) <code>213</code>.</li>
        <li>Follow FS <code>213</code> for a few miles. You will pass the main turnoff for the Stoneman Lake viewpoint.</li>
        <li>According to your map, you will eventually make a right turn onto <strong>FS <code>230</code></strong>. Follow this until you see the turn for <strong>FS <code>230E</code></strong> on your left.</li>
        <li>The area you've marked with a red arrow on your map is along this road.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Timing Analysis</h2>
    <p>Your timeline is tight but very doable if you are efficient.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>10:00 AM:</strong> Arrive home from T-ball. Final packing of cooler and last-minute items.</li>
        <li><strong>1:00 PM:</strong> Depart from Phoenix.</li>
        <li><strong>~2:45 - 3:15 PM:</strong> Arrive at Exit 306 (Stoneman Lake Rd). This accounts for about 1.5-2 hours of driving.</li>
        <li><strong>~3:15 - 4:00 PM:</strong> Drive the forest roads (FS <code>213</code> -> FS <code>230</code> -> FS <code>230E</code>) to find the perfect spot. Speed on these roads is slow (15-25 mph).</li>
        <li><strong>Sunset on Nov 8, 2025 will be around 5:28 PM.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This gives you roughly <strong>1.5 to 2 hours of solid daylight</strong> to select your site, set up your tent, get organized, and gather firewood before dark.</p>

    <h2>Campsite Selection on FS 230E</h2>
    <p>This is dispersed camping, which means no designated sites, toilets, or water.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Look for existing spots:</strong> Drive slowly down FS 230E and look for small pull-offs or clearings that already have a stone fire ring. Using an existing site minimizes your impact on the land.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> When you find a spot, look up! Avoid parking or setting up your tent directly under large, dead branches (often called "widowmakers").</li>
        <li><strong>Leave No Trace:</strong> Choose a spot on a durable surface (dirt, pine needles) at least 200 feet from any water sources and the main road.</li>
    </ul>
